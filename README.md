# STOCK MARKET PREDICTOR

A stock market predictor application that utilizes machine learning models to forecast stock prices.
## OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to develop a stock market predictor application that uses machine learning models to forecast stock prices. By analyzing historical stock data and employing various predictive algorithms, this application aims to provide users with valuable insights into potential future price movements of selected stocks. The goal is to assist investors in making informed decisions and optimizing their investment strategies based on reliable predictions.



## INTRODUCTION

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. However, with the advancement of machine learning techniques, it has become possible to develop predictive models that can analyze historical market data and identify patterns to forecast future price movements. The Stock Market Predictor project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze historical stock data, extract relevant features, and train predictive models capable of making accurate stock price predictions. By utilizing a combination of technical indicators and fundamental data, this application aims to provide users with reliable forecasts for their investment decisions.



## DATASET 

TThe dataset used in this project contains historical stock market data for various publicly traded companies. The dataset includes features such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and trading volume. The target variable is the closing price of the stock. The dataset is obtained from the Yahoo Finance API and covers a wide range of stocks across different sectors and industries.

# Features
1. Date: Date of the trading day.
2. Open: Opening price of the stock.
3. High: Highest price of the stock during the trading day.
4. Low: Lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
5. Close: Closing price of the stock.
6. Volume: Volume of shares traded during the day.

## MODELS

The project utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for stock price prediction. The model is trained on historical stock data using a machine learning architecture and is capable of forecasting future stock prices based on the provided input features.
